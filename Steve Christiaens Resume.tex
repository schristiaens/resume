\resheading{Hardware Engineering Projects} % If printed as a seperate page, get more detailed in the descriptions!  What type of processor?  What program used? Etc.
	
	\begin{description}
		\item[4 and 8 bit RISC CPUs] {\footnotesize Simple CPUs designed using CircuitMaker (no HDL) which contained ALUs, counters, registers, and 1K RAM all designed from scratch}
		\item[Simple Calculator] {\footnotesize Designed a simple calculator from the ground up using Xilinx ISE and Verilog HDL} % Get schematic block diagram for this one!
		\item[Stereo Amplifier] {\footnotesize Contained I/O as well as bass, treble, and volume controls}
		\item[Power Supply Basics] {\footnotesize Learned about the very basics of power supply design using transformers, rectifiers, and zener diodes and voltage regulators.} 
		\item[Parallel Port Game Controller] {\footnotesize Went through the start to finish development process of a game controller including driver development, microprocessor  \& ADC design (8255 MicroBoard; N.I.	ADC0809), and PCB design}
		\item[Portable Microphone Amplifier] {\footnotesize Utilized a series of transistors to amplify sound in a room with a potentiometer as volume control}
		\item[MP3 Player] {\footnotesize Developed an MP3 player using the Analog Devices BlackFin BF533 microprocessor and EZ-KIT development kit which utilized interrupts and audio codec}  % get link to block diagram for this one!
		\item[INL Remote Cell Phone Control] {\footnotesize Senior project which developed a prototype for Idaho National Laboratories allowing them to remote control a cell phone via 802.11g and bluetooth at a range greater than 6000ft consisting of 3 major components: central control, wireless medium, and embedded systems for chuckar box}
		\item[Inverted Pendulum] {\footnotesize Used sliding mode feedback control and inverted pendulum kit to keep metal rod standing vertially on a swingin arm}
		\item[FM Transmitter] {\footnotesize Built a simple FM Transmitter based off of given schematics as an introduction to FM modulation signals}
	\end{description}


\resheading{Software Engineering Projects}  % There really are a TON of projects I can put on this, but here are some major ones:
	\begin{description}
		\item[Book Keyword Scanner] {\footnotesize Developed a program which will take any input file and, given a keyword search, will return the frequency of that word }
		\item[Pedigree Chart] {\footnotesize Developed a program which will parse through a pedigree file and display a pedigree chart in the command line}
		\item[Factory Nail Rejection] {\footnotesize This program was simulating a factory which produced nails that had to be a very specific length, and if it wasn't, the program would reject it}
		\item[Calendar Program] {\footnotesize Given the time and date to display, the calendar program would display a simple calendar on the command line which took into account leap years}
		\item[Normal Distribution] {\footnotesize This program simulated the classic wheel of fortune blinko game where several thousand chip were statistially recorded and displayed as they dropped into a board filled with pegs}
		\item[RSA Encryption] {\footnotesize Developed an application which utilized the RSA encryption method to encrypt and decrypt messages}
